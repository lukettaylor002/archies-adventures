# My Trip to Martin Mere Wetland Centre 🦦

On the last week of the holidays we went to **Martin Mere Wetland Centre** in Lancashire with my Nana and Grandad and my little sister Lois.

## 🐟 Pond Dipping
When we got there we first went pond dipping. Pond dipping is where you have a net and you scoop up different things from inside the pond like insects, snails, fish and hopping things.  

Before we started, a lady told us how to do it:
1. Fill a white tub halfway with pond water  
2. Scoop some plant weeds into the pond water  
3. Start dipping!  
4. At the end when you want to empty the bucket you have to place it on the water and tip everything back in gently to protect the wildlife.  

Then we had lunch. We took a picnic with a nice ham sandwich, fruit and cakes. 🍰

## 🦤 Weird & Wonderful
Weird & Wonderful is where there’s lots of these birds, and they’re all like… they look really weird but they’re also really wonderful too.  

There we saw loads of strange duck-looking things and birds that looked like oversized pigeons.  
We saw something called a **Spoonbill** – which is a big bird with a long beak that looks like a spoon with a yellow end.

## 🐲 Dragonfly Festival
The **Dragonfly Festival** is a big trail all around the park.  

It has lots of different coloured dragonflies and they’ve each got a number (up to ten). You have to find them all and write the number on a little booklet that you get at the start. The booklet shows all of the dragonflies around the park.  

We didn’t find them all though, because we were rushing to the otters and then to the adventure playground. So I don’t know what you get if you complete it!

## 🦦 Otters & 🦩 Flamingos
We were rushing because we wanted to go to the **feeding of the otters**.  

We got there in time to watch them feed two otters some little sardines. They were super cute! 🐟🦦  
Afterwards the otters went back to bed — I think they were tired.  

On the way to the adventure playground we passed the flamingos. I think there were about **100 flamingos**!

## 🛝 Adventure Playground
Make sure you bring some waterproofs, because there’s **Paddle and Play** if you want to go there.  

The adventure playground itself is really fun. There’s a huge slide that you climb up to using a big red rope before sliding down.
