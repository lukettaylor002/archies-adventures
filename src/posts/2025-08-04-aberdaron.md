## 🏖️ Whistling Sands
We went to Whistling Sands, and the reason it's called Whistling Sands is because when you step on it, it whistles.  
It's really cool, I really liked it. We went up this big hill next week, we saw lots of rock pools, and we saw some fish in there.  

## 🏖️ Aberdaron Beach
We went to Aberdaron Beach. It was really cool and it was really busy too.  
I went in the sea a lot and I did a bit of swimming and I had lots of ice cream.  

## 🦭 Seals & Lifeboats
I saw a seal; it was a grey one. I wish I saw another one because it said there were 5000.  
I thought, *"Ew, don't live there."* I want to see another. I want to go back and see another seal again.  

I also saw a real lifeboat — it was really, really big and it had lots of different controls.  

## 🍁 National Trust
Next to the Darren beach there was this National Trust Centre.  
When you got in, it was quite dark, but then you could see stuff about seals, about puffins, about lots of things.  

It was really fun. I went in with my sister and my mum.  
We had ice cream every day. I got lots of different flavours.  

## 🏡 Our Cottage
I lived in a really nice cottage. It has this big fire that hangs down from the ceiling.  
It was really fun. I had a really nice and cosy bedroom.
