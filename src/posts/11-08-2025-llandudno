# My Trip to Llandudno 🎢

When we went, we had to go all the way from our holiday home to **Conwy**.  
It was quite far because we stayed in Conwy and Llandudno, and we had to go all around the parking lot.  
We couldn’t find many spaces — it was a bit far away.

## 🎢 The Pier
I went on the pier; it was really big.

---

## 🧱 Legos!
I got four different Legos:

- Sonic  
- Super Sonic  
- Harry Potter  
- One of Harry Potter’s teachers  

---

## 💎 The Gemstone
I also got a gemstone (basically a crystal, but I call it a gemstone).

---

## 🏖️ The Beach
I went on the sand beach after that; it was really cool.

---

## 🚡 The Cable Cars
Then, after that, I went on the cable cars — they’re like these little cart thingies that go on wires in the sky, and you go all the way across a big hill.
